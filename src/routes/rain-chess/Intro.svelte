                Rain Protocol enables you to build web3 economies at scale. Weather it be integrating web3 into an 
                exsisting ecosystem or building a new one, rain empowers communities and developers to build launchpads, 
                games, game studios, DAOs or virtual artists, sell land or bootstrap a creative project; either out of 
                the box or configurable by you, pre-audited, permissionless and available on any EVM compatible chain .
                Rain is web3 lego. Snap pieces together, build something, then snap new pieces together tomorrow and do something new.
